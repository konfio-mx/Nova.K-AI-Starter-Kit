## Knowledge-Enhanced Agents

Knowledge-enhanced agents combine LLMs with retrieval from vector databases to provide accurate, up-to-date information.

### Setting Up a Knowledge Base

1. **Prepare Your Documents**:
   - Break documents into chunks (paragraphs or sections)
   - Clean and normalize the text

2. **Create a Collection in Qdrant**:

   ```javascript
   // In n8n HTTP Request node
   {
     "method": "PUT",
     "url": "http://qdrant:6333/collections/knowledge_base",
     "body": {
       "vectors": {
         "size": 1536,
         "distance": "Cosine"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Generate Embeddings**:
   - Use the Ollama node with embedding operation
   - Or use OpenAI's embedding API

4. **Store in Qdrant**:

   ```javascript
   // In n8n HTTP Request node
   {
     "method": "PUT",
     "url": "http://qdrant:6333/collections/knowledge_base/points",
     "body": {
       "points": [
         {
           "id": 1,
           "vector": [0.1, 0.2, ...],
           "payload": {
             "text": "Document chunk content",
             "source": "document_name.pdf",
             "page": 5
           }
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

1. **Query Processing**:
   - Generate embedding for user query
   - Search vector database for relevant documents

2. **Context Assembly**:
   - Combine retrieved documents into context
   - Format for LLM consumption

3. **Response Generation**:
   - Send query + context to LLM
   - Generate response based on retrieved knowledge

## Multi-Agent Systems

Complex problems often benefit from multiple specialized agents working together.

### Agent Orchestration

1. **Define Agent Roles**:
   - Researcher: Gathers information
   - Analyst: Processes and evaluates data
   - Writer: Generates final output
   - Critic: Reviews and suggests improvements

2. **Communication Patterns**:
   - Sequential: Agents work in a pipeline
   - Parallel: Agents work simultaneously
   - Hierarchical: Manager agents delegate to worker agents

3. **Implementation in n8n**:
   - Create separate workflows for each agent
   - Use webhooks for inter-agent communication
   - Store shared state in database or context

## Tool-Using Agents

Empower your agents with tools to interact with external systems and perform actions.

### Tool Integration

1. **Define Tool Interface**:
   - Name and description
   - Input parameters
   - Output format

2. **Implement Tool Logic**:
   - Create n8n nodes for each tool
   - Handle error cases
   - Format outputs consistently

3. **Tool Selection Logic**:
   - Let the LLM decide which tool to use
   - Parse the LLM's response to extract tool calls
   - Execute the selected tool with provided parameters

### Example Tool Definition

```javascript
const tools = [
  {
    name: "search_database",
    description: "Search the customer database for information",
    parameters: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        query: {
          type: "string",
          description: "The search query"
        },
        limit: {
          type: "number",
          description: "Maximum number of results"
        }
      },
      required: ["query"]
    }
  }
];
```

## Conversational Memory

Maintain context across multiple interactions to create more coherent agent experiences.

### Memory Types

1. **Short-Term Memory**:
   - Store recent conversation turns
   - Include in context window for LLM

2. **Long-Term Memory**:
   - Store key information in vector database
   - Retrieve relevant memories based on current context

3. **Structured Memory**:
   - Store entities and relationships in database
   - Update as new information is discovered

### Implementation

1. **Session Management**:
   - Create unique session IDs for conversations
   - Store conversation history in PostgreSQL

2. **Memory Retrieval**:
   - Before generating a response, fetch relevant history
   - Include in the prompt to the LLM

3. **Memory Summarization**:
   - When context gets too long, summarize older parts
   - Store summaries as higher-level memories

## Integration with External Systems

Connect your agents to existing business systems for maximum value.

### API Integration

1. **Authentication**:
   - Store credentials securely in n8n
   - Use OAuth where available

2. **Data Transformation**:
   - Convert between API formats and agent-friendly formats
   - Handle pagination and rate limiting

3. **Webhook Receivers**:
   - Create endpoints to receive events from external systems
   - Process and route events to appropriate agent workflows

### Database Integration

1. **Query Generation**:
   - Use LLMs to generate SQL from natural language
   - Validate and sanitize before execution

2. **Result Processing**:
   - Format database results for LLM consumption
   - Generate summaries of large result sets

## Performance Optimization

Ensure your agents are efficient, responsive, and cost-effective.

### Prompt Optimization

1. **Prompt Compression**:
   - Remove unnecessary details
   - Focus on relevant context

2. **Few-Shot Learning**:
   - Include examples for complex tasks
   - Structure examples consistently

### Model Selection

1. **Task-Appropriate Models**:
   - Use smaller models for simple tasks
   - Reserve larger models for complex reasoning

2. **Local vs. Cloud Models**:
   - Use local models for sensitive data
   - Use cloud models for higher quality when needed

### Caching Strategies

1. **Response Caching**:
   - Cache common queries and responses
   - Invalidate cache when knowledge changes

2. **Embedding Caching**:
   - Store embeddings to avoid regeneration
   - Update only when content changes

## Next Steps
