# Key Concepts in AI Agent Development

This document explains the fundamental concepts behind AI agents and how they're implemented in the Nova.K starter kit.

## What is an AI Agent?

An AI agent is a software entity that can perceive its environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. In the context of this starter kit, AI agents are workflows that combine:

1. **Input/Trigger Mechanisms**: Ways to receive requests or detect events
2. **Processing Logic**: Decision-making and data transformation steps
3. **AI Components**: LLM-powered reasoning, generation, or analysis
4. **Output Actions**: Methods to deliver results or perform actions

## Core Components

### 1. Workflows

Workflows are the backbone of AI agents in this starter kit. They define the sequence of steps an agent takes from receiving input to delivering output. In n8n, workflows consist of:

- **Triggers**: Events that start the workflow (webhooks, schedules, etc.)
- **Nodes**: Individual processing steps (API calls, transformations, etc.)
- **Connections**: The flow of data between nodes

### 2. Large Language Models (LLMs)

LLMs provide the "intelligence" in AI agents. They can:

- Generate human-like text responses
- Understand and analyze content
- Make decisions based on context
- Extract structured information from unstructured text

In this starter kit, LLMs are accessed through:

- **Ollama**: For running models locally
- **External APIs**: OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, etc. (optional)

### 3. Vector Databases

Vector databases store and retrieve information based on semantic similarity rather than exact matching. This enables:

- Knowledge retrieval for answering questions
- Semantic search capabilities
- Finding similar content or recommendations

Qdrant is the vector database included in this starter kit.

### 4. Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing effective instructions for LLMs. Good prompts:

- Clearly define the task and constraints
- Provide necessary context
- Specify the desired output format
- Include examples when helpful

## Agent Patterns

### 1. Reactive Agents

Reactive agents respond directly to triggers like:

- User questions via webhooks
- Scheduled events
- Database changes
- External API calls

### 2. Proactive Agents

Proactive agents initiate actions based on:

- Time-based schedules
- Monitoring and detecting conditions
- Predictive analysis

### 3. Multi-step Reasoning Agents

These agents break complex problems into steps:

- Chain-of-thought reasoning
- Tool use for gathering information
- Self-reflection and refinement

### 4. Collaborative Agents

Multiple specialized agents working together:

- Different roles and capabilities
- Communication between agents
- Orchestration of complex workflows

## Agent Development Lifecycle

1. **Define the Goal**: What problem is the agent solving?
2. **Design the Workflow**: Map out the steps and decision points
3. **Implement Components**: Build each part of the workflow
4. **Test & Refine**: Evaluate performance and improve
5. **Deploy & Monitor**: Put the agent into production and track its performance

## Best Practices

- **Start Simple**: Begin with basic workflows before adding complexity
- **Test Thoroughly**: Validate agent behavior across different inputs
- **Monitor Performance**: Track usage, errors, and outcomes
- **Iterate Quickly**: Continuously improve based on feedback
- **Consider Ethics**: Ensure responsible AI use and appropriate safeguards
